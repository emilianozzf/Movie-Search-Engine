1. How to build and run the code:
    * make
    * ./sort

2. An example of the input and output:
    * The unsorted array of ints: 7 27 5 31 20 29 26 14 26 21 30 4 28 19 25 16 4 23 27 27 7 16 28 5 25 14 3 7 12 8 19 18 
    * The number of comparisons: 191
    * The sorted array of ints: 3 4 4 5 5 7 7 7 8 12 14 14 16 16 18 19 19 20 21 23 25 25 26 26 27 27 27 28 28 29 30 31

3. Description of the files in the directory:
    * sort.h
    * sort.c
    * main.c
    * Makefile
    * writeup.md
    * README.md

4. External libraries the code relies on:
    * None

5. The assumptions I made about the code:
    * The input unsorted array length shoud be power of 2.

6. A summary of the project:
    * Implemented a given sorting algorithm.
    * Analyzed its time complexity.
    * Compared it with Bubble Sort in terms of time complexity.

7. What was hard or tricky:
    * Understanding the given algorithm.
    * Determining the reasonable input array lenghts for anaylysis.

8. How much time you spent on it:
    * About 4 hours.
